AdTaCo - Advanced Task Controller

Introduction
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Lists all processes, their threads and open files. Is able to maintain a
blacklist and can stop such processes automatically. Gives information
about processes e.g. the path, their arguments, their heap memory.
The program is like Sysinternals Process Explorer only that it has
less/other features, other aims and another GUI. Main goal is to have
full control over wanted/unwanted processes and to sort them automatically
so the user sees what is going on.

Features
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- Manages an application blacklist which contains files which never
  should allowed to run on the computer.
- User-defined scripts can be connected with a toolbar button
  and kill/restart applications/services with one click.
